    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Zenodo has an API, but we wanted an API that would serve the needs of the Biodiversity Literature Repository community. Additionally, we wanted to provide more documentation and hand-holding than is provided by Zenodo. While we were at it, we also decided to document the API using the OpenAPI 3.0 specifications.</p>
